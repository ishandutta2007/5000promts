```
I am the CEO of a medium sized company. Write a short email that is humorous yet professional to my regional manager. Ask them to:
- send me an up-to-date list of our paper stock
- organize a meeting this week with other regional managers
- let me know how the company-wide AI workshop went at their office
```
